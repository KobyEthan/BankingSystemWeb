# BankingSystemWeb
This repository was a project that I worked on for one of my classes of my Bachelor's degree: E-Business Application Development.
It is a simulation of what a banking application might look like with some of the functionalities that such an application might need. 
Note, that this project was not graded on the CSS page or how it looked in general so it is quite ugly. 
Additionally, a few of the functionalities are currently bugged. Those funnctionalities include: transfer_funds, edit_user_roles, and edit_acounts.
The code that I had direct involvment in making can all be found in the src and web folders. You can also find the SQL file that I used to populate the database in the database package in the src folder. There, you can find the username and password of all of the users that are currently in the database if you wish to log into the application and use some of the functionalities. Also note that the functionalities differ based on which user logs in due to their role type attribute. 
This application was developed and tested using NetBeans.
