# BankingSystemWeb
This repository was a project that I worked on for one of my classes of my Bachelor's degree: E-Business Application Development.
It is a simulation of what a banking application might look like with some of the functionalities that such an application might need. 
Note, that this project was not graded on the CSS page or how it looked in general so it is quite ugly. 
Additionally, a few of the functionalities are currently bugged. Those funnctionalities include: transfer_funds, edit_user_roles, and edit_acounts.
The code that I had direct involvment in making can all be found in the src and web folders. 
This application was developed and tested using NetBeans.
